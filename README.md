# Research Track 2 assignment 1 - Action - Doxygen

The Branch Doxygen contains the same package of Action, but we added a documentation using Doxygen.


## Instruction how to run the code:

1. Open a terminal (ROS sourced) then execute
```
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 sim.launch
```
Note: 
* The documentation can found in `rt2_assignment1/docs/html/` folder.
* Open `files.html` with *Firefox web browser*.
