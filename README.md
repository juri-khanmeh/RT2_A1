# Research Track 2 assignment 1 - Action - Sphinx

The Branch action contains the same package in ROS, but with the go_to_point node modelled as a "ROS action" server, instead of a "simple" server.
Given that, the robot FSM node should now implement mechanisms for possibly cancelling the goal, when the related user command is received.



## Instruction how to run the code:

1. Open a terminal (ROS sourced) then execute
```
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 sim.launch
```
